# Environment Setup

I just want to go over some of the things that you'll need for this course.

## Node.js

You'll need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). We need this because Next.js relies on Node.js to run server-side code and manage dependencies. We'll also be using npm, which is the package manager that comes with Node.js.

## Text Editor

You'll need a text editor to write your code. I recommend using Visual Studio Code, which you can download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's free and has a lot of great features for web development. There are a few extensions that I suggest using that we will use in the course and I'll go over those in a minute.

## Git

You'll need to have Git installed on your computer. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). We'll be using Git to manage our code and to deploy our projects to GitHub. We also need to have Git installed because we'll be using it to deploy our projects to Vercel. You should be using Git for version control in all of your projects, so it's a good idea to have it installed. You can use the command line to use Git or you can use VS Code's built-in Git features.

## React Dev Tools

You should have the React Dev Tools installed in your browser. You can download it from the Chrome Web Store or the Firefox Add-ons Store. We'll be using this to inspect the React components that we build and to debug our applications.

## MongoDB Compass

You should have MongoDB Compass installed on your computer. You can download it from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/). We'll be using this to inspect the data in our MongoDB databases. You don't need to install this right away, but you will need it later in the course.

## VS Code Extensions

There are a few extensions that I recommend using with Visual Studio Code. You can install these by going to the Extensions view and searching for them. Here are the ones that I recommend:

#### Prettier

Prettier is a code formatter that we'll be using to format our code. It's a good idea to have this installed so that you can format your code with a keyboard shortcut. I have it set up so that it formats my code every time I save a file. To set this, you can go to the settings and search for "format on save" and check the box.

#### ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets

This extension gives you a lot of useful snippets for writing React code. I use this to generate all of my React components. We can just type `rafce` and it will generate a component with an arrow function and an export at the bottom. It's a huge time saver.

#### JavaScript (ES6) code snippets

This is useful for things like console logs and try/catch blocks. It's a good idea to have this installed so that you can write code faster.

#### Multiple Cursor Case Preserver

This extension is useful for preserving the case of your text when you're using multiple cursors. It's a small thing but it's really useful.

Two other extensions that I use all of the time but I won't be using in this course are GitHub Copilot and Turbo Console Log. GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code and offers suggestions and Turboo console log is a console log generator that helps you write console logs faster. I highly recommend both of these extensions but they do put things in with your code and I think it can confuse some people that are watching the course. So I won't be using them in this course but I do recommend them.
