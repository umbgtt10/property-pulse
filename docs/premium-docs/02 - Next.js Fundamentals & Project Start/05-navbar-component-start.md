# Navbar Component

Alright so now we are going to start on the navbar component. Let's create a new folder called `components` in the root of our project NOT in the `app` folder. This is where we will put all of our UI components. There is a bit of a debate on whether or not to put the components in the `app` folder or in the root of the project. I prefer to put them in the root of the project because I like to keep the `app` folder for page components and API routes. It's up to you though. Putting them in the `app` folder is perfectly fine.

Create a new file called `Navbar.jsx` in the `components` folder. We'll start by creating a component called `Navbar`:

```jsx
const Navbar = () => {
  return <div>Navbar</div>;
};
export default Navbar;
```

Now we can import the `Navbar` component into the `app/layout.jsx` component:

```jsx
import Navbar from '@/components/Navbar';
```

Put it right above the `<main>` tag:

```jsx
const MainLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <html lang='en'>
      <body>
        <Navbar />
        <main>{children}</main>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
};
```

You should see the word "Navbar" on all pages. Now we can start building out the navbar.

## Navbar HTML

The navbar HTML can be found in the `theme-files/index.html` file. You can copy that if you want, however, there are quite a few changes when it comes to HTML vs JSX. I will attach a file named `Navbar.jsx` to this lesson and to the end of this document. This will be the final code for this lesson. So you can just grab that if you would like.

Here are the changes to be made:

- All the `class` attributes need to be changed to `className`.
- For SVG attributes, you need to change the attributes to camelCase. So `stroke-width` to `strokeWidth` and `stroke-linecap` to `strokeLinecap`, etc.
- The comments need to be changed to `{/* */}`.
- Import logo and profile image.
- The `<img>` tag needs to be changed to the `<Image>` component from Next.js. 

### Change Class to ClassName

First, let's change all of the `class` attributes to `className`. For example, the `<nav>` tag should look like this:

```jsx
 <nav className='bg-blue-700 border-b border-blue-500'>
```

### SVG Attributes

Next, we need to change the SVG attributes to camelCase. For example, the `<svg>` tag should look like this:

```jsx
<svg
  className='block h-6 w-6'
  fill='none'
  viewBox='0 0 24 24'
  strokeWidth='1.5'
  stroke='currentColor'
  aria-hidden='true'
>
  <path
    strokeLinecap='round'
    strokeLinejoin='round'
    d='M3.75 6.75h16.5M3.75 12h16.5m-16.5 5.25h16.5'
  />
</svg>
```

### Comments

Next, we need to change the comments to `{/* */}`. For example, the logo comment should look like this:

```jsx
{
  /* <!-- Logo --> */
}
```

### Image Component & Logo

We need to bring the images over from the theme files. Create a folder in your project at `/assets/images`. This will be for site images like the logo.

As far as the property images go, they will ultimately come from Cloudonary, but for now, we will just put them in the public folder. So create a folder at `/public/images`.

Open the `_theme_files` folder and bring the 4 files in the `_theme_files/images` folder to `assets/images`. Then Bring the entire `_theme_files/images/properties` folder into the `public/images` folder.

We will be using the Next.js `Image` component. This component is used to optimize images for the web. It will automatically resize images based on the viewport size. It will also lazy load images which means it will only load the images that are visible on the screen. Let's import that and the `logo-white.png` and `profile.png` image into the `Navbar.jsx` component:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';
import logo from '@/assets/images/logo-white.png';
import profileDefault from '@/assets/images/profile.png';
```

Then change the `<img>` tag to the `<Image>` component and add the `src` and `alt` attributes:

```jsx
<Image className='h-10 w-auto' src={logo} alt='PropertyPulse' />
```

Now you should see the logo on the screen.

Also, change the profile image from an `<img>` tag to the `<Image>` component and change the src, width, height attributes:

```jsx
<Image
  className='h-8 w-8 rounded-full'
  src={profileDefault}
  alt=''
/>
```

We will replace it with the actual image later.

In the next lesson, we will add the links, dropdowns and icons.
