# Clean Up Property Data

up to this point, we have been using demo data and images that are stored in our project files. Now that we can create properties, we need to clean up the demo data and images. You can handle this another way if you want, but I am going to now delete all of the dummy data and images.

## Delete Dummy Data

Open Compass or MongoDB Atlas and delete the 10 properties that we imported a while ago. I am also going to delete the properties that we added in the last lesson. This way we have a clean slate.

Delete all of the images and the entire directory `properties`.

## Add Some New Properties

Now I am going to add some new properties through the website. I will create 6 properties using the data from the `properties.json` file. I will also add some images for each property.

## Add As a Different User

I would also suggest that you create a new user and add some properties as that user. This way we can add the functionality later to list the properties of a specific user.

If you want to sign in as another user, you need to go into the Google developer console and add the new user's email address as a test user.
